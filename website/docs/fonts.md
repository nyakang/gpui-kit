# Fonts

## Default fonts

Every app starts with a UI font and a monospace font from the theme:

| Role | Family | Size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI text | `.SystemUIFont` | 16px |
| Code / monospace | macOS: `Menlo`, Windows: `Consolas`, Linux: `DejaVu Sans Mono` | 13px |

The editor paints its code in `mono_font_family` at `mono_font_size`. See
[Editor](../component/editor.md) for details.

Both defaults are checked against the installed fonts when the theme is
applied. A missing monospace default is swapped for an installed alternative,
and when `.SystemUIFont` resolves to one of GPUI's fallback families rather
than the system font itself (Linux desktops without the family GPUI maps it
to), the theme names that family directly so text lookups stay cached. A
family you set yourself is used as-is.

## System fonts

Desktop apps can use **any font installed on the OS** by name — no bundling,
no config. GPUI resolves the family live against the system collection
(CoreText on macOS, DirectWrite on Windows, fontconfig on Linux).

```rust
div().font_family("Segoe UI")

Editor::new(&editor).font_family("JetBrains Mono")
```

Common examples per platform:

- macOS: `SF Pro`, `Helvetica`, `Arial`, `Times New Roman`, `Menlo`, `Monaco`
- Windows: `Segoe UI`, `Arial`, `Consolas`, `Courier New`
- Linux: `Noto Sans`, `DejaVu Sans`, `Liberation Sans`, `DejaVu Sans Mono`

If the name does not match an installed font, GPUI falls back silently — so
verify the exact family name on each target platform.

## Changing fonts via Theme

Set the app-wide fonts through `Theme::update`, which syncs the base layer and refreshes every window:

```rust
Theme::update(cx, |theme| {
    theme.font_family = "Inter".into();
    theme.mono_font_family = "JetBrains Mono".into();
    theme.font_size = px(18.);
});
```

`font_size` doubles as the application zoom control — `Root` calls
`window.set_rem_size(cx.theme().font_size)`, so `rem`-based spacing scales
with it. See [Coding Guides](./coding-guides.md) for details.

## Per-element override

Any element accepts a font override without touching the theme:

```rust
div()
    .font_family("JetBrains Mono")
    .text_size(px(15.))
    .font_weight(FontWeight::BOLD)
```

These are ordinary [`Styled`](https://docs.rs/gpui/latest/gpui/trait.Styled.html)
methods, so they compose with the rest of the style chain.

## Bundling custom fonts

Fonts that are not installed on the user's system must be bundled and
registered with the text system **before the first frame**:

```rust
cx.text_system()
    .add_fonts(vec![Cow::Borrowed(
        include_bytes!("../fonts/MyFont-Regular.ttf").as_slice(),
    )])
    .expect("Failed to load fonts");
```

Then reference them by family name as usual:

```rust
Theme::update(cx, |theme| theme.font_family = "MyFont".into());
```

The gallery's web build bundles `Inter`, `JetBrains Mono`, `Noto Sans SC` and
`IBM Plex Sans` this way — see `crates/story-web/src/lib.rs`.

## Theme JSON config

Font families and sizes can also come from a theme file:

```json
{
    "font.family": "Inter",
    "font.size": 16,
    "mono_font.family": "JetBrains Mono",
    "mono_font.size": 13
}
```

Load it with `ThemeRegistry`:

```rust
ThemeRegistry::watch_dir(PathBuf::from("./themes"), cx, move |cx| {
    if let Some(theme) = ThemeRegistry::global(cx).themes().get(&theme_name).cloned() {
        Theme::update(cx, |current| current.apply_config(&theme));
    }
});
```

See [Theme](../component/theme.md) for the full config reference.

## WebAssembly note

Browsers expose **no system fonts** to WASM apps. The `story-web` gallery
(which runs at `gpui-kit.com/gallery/`) must bundle every family it uses and
re-assert them after `Theme::change`, or the text system panics. Desktop apps
skip this entirely.

Text the bundled fonts cannot draw can still come from the browser. The web
platform renders emoji through Canvas 2D with the visitor's local fonts, so
an application does not have to bundle an emoji font. The policy is chosen
when the platform is constructed and cannot change afterwards:

| `CanvasFontFallback` | Browser draws |
| --- | --- |
| `Emoji` (default) | Emoji, including skin tones, flags, keycaps and ZWJ sequences |
| `EmojiAndCjk` | Emoji plus horizontal Han, kana and modern Hangul text |
| `Disabled` | Nothing; only bundled fonts are used |

`gpui_kit::application()` and `gpui_kit::platform::single_threaded_web()` keep
the default. To widen it, build the platform yourself:

```rust
use gpui_kit::web::{CanvasFontFallback, WebBackendPreference, WebPlatform};

let platform = Rc::new(WebPlatform::new_with_backend_and_font_fallback(
    false,
    WebBackendPreference::Auto,
    CanvasFontFallback::EmojiAndCjk,
));
let http_client = Arc::new(platform.fetch_http_client());
let app = Application::with_platform(platform).with_http_client(http_client);
```

Bundled fonts stay preferred wherever they have the glyph. The fallback draws
each grapheme on its own, so CJK text rendered this way favors readability
over exact spacing and font features, and its appearance depends on the
fonts installed on the visitor's machine. The gallery opts into
`EmojiAndCjk`: its bundled fonts hold only the glyphs its own stories use, and
anything a visitor types into an input would otherwise render as tofu.
